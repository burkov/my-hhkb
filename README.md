# About
This is my QMK configuration for HHKB2 keyboard. I use Hasu alternative programmable controller.

# How to re-configure
Upload json file to the [QMK configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/hhkb/LAYOUT) change layout whatever you like, then compile and download firmware in HEX format.

Open downloaded firmware in the QMK toolbox, enter programming mode on the keyboard by pressing the only button on the controller (`DFU device connected`), then press Flash.

Controller will exit programming mode automatically after flashing procedure.

# Layout
Mac-flavored keymap, no lefthand side Ctrl:
